Isn't it great (audience repeats)
To be an Aussie (audience repeats)
Takin' a walk (audience repeats)
Along the street (audience repeats)
Lookin' in shops (audience repeats)
Or buying a paper (audience repeats)
Or Stopping to have a yarn with people that you meet! (All together)

Down at the pub (audience repeats)
Or at a party (audience repeats)
Whenever you're stuck (audience repeats)
For what to say (audience repeats)
If you wanna be dinky-di (audience repeats)
Why don't you give it a try? (audience repeats)
Look 'em right in the eye and say g'day (All together)

And how's it go-o-o-ing,
Just say g'day g'day g'day and you'll be right

When Italians meet they all go cray (wooooo!)
The blokes all like to hug each other too (eww!)
The Yanks invited "Hi" and "See you later" (That's us!)
A Pommy will shake your hand and say "How do you do!"

Watch out for the French Man, or he'll kiss you! (Mwaa!)
The Spaniards go for "Olah" and "Olay" (Olay!)
But in the land of the Cock-a-too
Pole cats and teh didgeridoo!
When you meet an Aussie ten-to-one here's what he'll say .....
