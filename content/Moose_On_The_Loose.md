# Moose On The Loose

(Repeat after me song)

There was a great big moose!
He liked to drink a lot of juice
There was a great big moose!
He liked to drink a lot of juice.

The mooses name was Fred!
He liked to drink his juice in bed
The mooses name was Fred!
He liked to drink his juice in bed

He drank his juice with care!
But he spilt some on his hair
He drank his juice with care!
But he spilt some on his hair

Now he's a sticky moose!
Out on the loooooooooose (all together)
